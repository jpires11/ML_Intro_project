### Preprocessing
- The data requires preprocessing before modeling.

### Models
- **Linear Regression**
  - Works effectively for the given data.

- **Logistic Regression**
  - Not suitable as the problem is not a classification task.

- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
  - Works but requires selecting the number of folds in cross-validation.

- **L2 and L1**
  - Rigid regulation is better 
- **Gradient descend**
  - learning rate at 0.01 is better and 0.1 won't work because it's too high
- **Splines**
  - TO DO
- **Artificial Neurons and multilayer perceptrons and polynomial fitting**
  - TO DO
- **Tree-based methode**
   - TO DO
- **Random forests and gradient boosting**
  - TO DO
- **K-means clustering and hierarchical clustering**
