# Machine Learning Project: Prediction of Retention Time
You can find the report in the file ML_BIO_322.pdf.
To run the code and get the same results that were posted on kaggle you will need to use the function reproduce_results in main.py. This function will use the best model and their best hyperparameter that we found during this project. If you change the boolean used by the model you will run the Gridsearch and this will increase the computation time. To be sure not to change the hyperparamter just use the function has it is.
